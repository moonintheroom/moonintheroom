  <summary>🌅 About My Name</summary>
  <br>
  My full name is **LEE DONGHEE (이동희)**.  

  - **Dong (東)**: East  
  - **Hee (熹)**: Shine / Radiant  

  It means:  
  > “Shine brightly from the East.” 🌅✨  

  Inspired by this meaning, I chose the English name **Lucy**,  
  derived from the Latin word _“lux”_, meaning **light**.  
  And for a bit of personal touch, I stylize it as **LUCIEE** on GitHub.

## 💬 Who am I?

> **Q: What technologies or fields am I most immersed in these days?**

**A:**  
Like many developers, I’m deeply interested in AI.  
Lately, I’ve been particularly focused on **LLMs (Large Language Models)** and **Object Detection** in deep learning.  
I enjoy exploring new trends and imagining how these technologies can be applied in meaningful, real-world ways.  
Ultimately, my dream is to **build software that powers AI robots** — bringing intelligence to life through code.

> **Q: What kind of developer do I want to become?**

**A:**  
I want to be a developer who **truly understands people** — not only the users but also the engineers I work with.  
To improve communication and collaboration, I’ve been studying computer networks and system design.  
I always try to **step into the user's shoes**, even before writing a single line of code.

  <summary>🔍 Two key experiences that shaped my mindset</summary>
  <br>

1. **VPN Solution Developer**  
   At my previous job, I developed a VPN solution. To better understand its shortcomings,  
   I used it myself every day — at home, on weekends, and outside of work hours.  
   I took detailed notes on anything that felt inconvenient and added them to the team backlog.  
   This experience taught me how much I care about what I build, and how deeply I want users to **trust and love** the tools I create.

2. **Current Project: Online Sales Automation (Solo Dev)**  
   After leaving the company, I started building a product that automates online selling.  
   I became my own customer by opening a real online store and experiencing the full workflow firsthand.  
   Every pain point became an opportunity.  
   To ensure long-term adaptability, I designed the system using **Microservice Architecture (MSA)** so I can easily expand it with new modules.  
   Though I took a short break to study AI, I plan to resume development in the second week of April.

> **Q: What do I value most when working with a team?**

**A:**  
I believe the most important element in teamwork is **mutual understanding** —  
as abstract as that might sound. When a team goes through friction or misalignment,  
empathy becomes the courage that helps us endure and move forward.

I’ve worked with people who:  
1. Only take high-impact tasks to build their own career  
2. Visibly show frustration when things don’t go their way  
3. Ignore team direction and act independently  

These situations weren’t easy, but we got through them by being honest, confronting issues directly, and learning from each other.  
To me, it’s crucial to **distinguish between short-term and long-term teams**:  

- In short-term projects, I focus purely on execution and delivery.  
- In long-term teams, I try to grow together — complementing each other's gaps and building trust.  

That’s why I care deeply about **how I speak**,  
and I always try to understand what others truly need before responding.  
If we ever work together, I hope this mindset becomes part of what we build.

> **Q: What motivates me to code every day?**

**A:**  
There’s something electrifying about how code allows data to move, connect, and ultimately **interact with people**.  
Among the many wonderful things in the world, I feel incredibly lucky that I get to be part of this one — building systems that serve people.

To me, coding is about finding discomfort, then relieving it.  
That’s exactly what I tried to do in my online store automation project:  
observe what felt inconvenient, and transform it into an opportunity for improvement.

I also feel fortunate to be a developer in the age of AI —  
a technology that holds **immense potential** for solving problems.  
But I’m also aware that this power, when misused, can be dangerous.  
We see it today in the rise of deepfake scams and voice fraud.

That’s why I believe it’s equally important to **educate others on using AI responsibly**,  
and to guide its applications toward good.  
With my academic background in culture, I hope to become someone who can help balance AI’s influence  
— especially when it starts shaping the way people live, think, and connect.

✨ In the end, my motivation is simple:  
To use powerful tools to **ease the discomforts of people around me — and myself**.
