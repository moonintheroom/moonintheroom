  <summary>🌅 About My Name</summary>

  My full name is **LEE DONGHEE (이동희)**.  

  - **Dong (東)**: East  
  - **Hee (熹)**: Shine / Radiant  

  It means:  
  > “Shine brightly from the East.” 🌅✨  

  Inspired by this meaning, I chose the English name **Lucy**,  
  derived from the Latin word _lux_, meaning **light**.  
  On GitHub, I stylize it as **LUCIEE** — a personal twist.

## 🧑‍🎓 Personal Inspiration

> **“Shine brightly from the East.”**  
That’s what my name means. And that’s what I strive to do — in life and in code.

I’m driven by a desire to build things that **lighten the load** for others — tools that are intuitive, reliable, and ethical.  
I believe great software comes from **understanding people first** — their needs, emotions, and hidden pain points.

## 💬 Who am I?

<details>
<summary>❓ What technologies or fields am I most immersed in these days?</summary>

Like many developers, I’m deeply interested in **AI**.  
Lately, I’ve been particularly focused on **LLMs (Large Language Models)** and **Object Detection**.  
I enjoy exploring new trends and imagining how these technologies can be applied in meaningful, real-world ways.  

Ultimately, my dream is to **build software that powers AI robots** —  
bringing intelligence to life through code.

<details>
<summary>❓ What kind of developer do I want to become?</summary>

I want to be a developer who **truly understands people** —  
not only the users but also the engineers I work with.  

To improve collaboration, I’ve been diving deep into **computer networks** and **system design**,  
and I always try to **step into the user’s shoes** — even before writing a single line of code.

<details>
<summary>🔍 Two key experiences that shaped my mindset</summary>

**1. VPN Solution Developer**  
I used my own product every day — at home, on weekends, in all environments.  
I took notes on every friction I experienced and turned those into backlog items.  
It showed me how much I care about what I build — and how deeply I want users to **trust and love** the tools I create.

**2. Online Sales Automation Project (Solo Dev)**  
I launched a real online store and became my own user.  
Every pain point became an opportunity.  

To ensure long-term adaptability, I designed the system with **Microservice Architecture (MSA)**  
— making it scalable and modular.  
After a short AI-focused break, I’ll resume this project in **April**.

<details>
<summary>❓ What do I value most when working with a team?</summary>

**Mutual understanding.** That’s the core.  
When a team faces friction, **empathy** becomes the courage that keeps us moving.

I've worked with people who:

1. Only took high-visibility tasks  
2. Reacted emotionally when things didn’t go their way  
3. Ignored the team’s direction  

They weren’t easy moments — but we got through them through honesty, direct communication, and shared growth.

For me, it’s important to distinguish:

- **Short-term teams** → Execution and delivery  
- **Long-term teams** → Trust-building, complementing each other’s strengths

That’s why I care about **how I speak**.  
And why I try to understand **what others truly need** — before I respond.
</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ What motivates me to code every day?</summary>

Because **code moves things**.  
It moves data. It connects people. It creates interaction.  

Among the many wonderful things in the world,  
I feel lucky to be part of this one — building systems that serve people.

To me, coding is about **relieving discomfort**.  
That’s what I did with my automation project:  
I found pain points, and turned them into improvements.

And in this era of AI, that motivation only grows.  
But power needs direction.  
Deepfakes and voice scams remind us: tech can harm.

That’s why I believe in **responsible AI** —  
and educating others to use it well.

With my background in culture, I hope to balance AI’s growing influence —  
especially as it begins to shape how people live, think, and feel.

✨ In the end, my motivation is simple:  
To use powerful tools to **ease the discomforts** of people around me — and myself.

<details>
<summary>❓ What kind of developer do I hope to be in the next 5 years?</summary>

If I can, I’d love to pursue **graduate studies in AI**.  
Though I studied culture, I hope to find a mentor — in academia or industry — who sees my potential.

NVIDIA’s curriculum gave me tools.  
But I’m still asking: *why does it work this way?*  
That curiosity drives me to dig deeper — past tools, into **principles**.

I also want to see **Korea lead AI** —  
not just in performance, but in **purpose** — with **culture at the center**.

<details>
<summary>📖 A story I always come back to</summary>

In 1999, **Sony** released a robot dog named **AIBO**.  
It comforted many people, especially those grieving pet loss.

In 2014, Sony announced it would stop repairing AIBO.  
Some people — devastated — held **funerals** for their robot dogs.

This wasn’t about technology anymore.  
It was about **culture**, **memory**, and **grief**.

Now, with AI inside, robots aren’t just tools.  
They’re becoming **emotional presences**, even **cultural artifacts**.

We, as developers, must ask:  
> **What responsibilities come with building things that move people’s hearts?**
</details>

Looking ahead, I want to build with that question in mind.  
A future full of AI and robotics is inevitable —  
but it’s up to us to make it **empathetic**, **ethical**, and **human**.

In 5 years, I may not have all the answers.  
But I hope to be someone who helps AI become a **responsible part** of daily life —  
not just **powerful**, but **trusted**.

And to become that person,  
I’ll keep learning, building, and listening — again and again.
